# Vehicle Rental Management System (C)

## Description
The Vehicle Rental Management System is a menu-driven mini project developed using the C programming language.  
It allows users to rent cars and bikes on an hourly or daily basis. The system tracks vehicle availability, calculates rental charges, and applies damage charges when a vehicle is returned in damaged condition.

Vehicle details such as ID, type, model, rental rates, availability status, and damage charges are stored in a file. File handling is used to ensure that vehicle data is preserved even after the program is closed and reopened.

This project demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, loops, conditional statements, and file handling in C.
